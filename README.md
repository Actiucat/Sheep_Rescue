# Sheep_Rescue
At the end I have implemented different new funcionalities, the first one are the visuals, the animation of the heart when the sheep is hitted by the hay.

I have also implemented the sounds of the cannon, the sheep when it is hitted and when it is dropped too.

Finally I have implemented the UI, with the counter so when you hit a sheep the hearts are raised +1, and if a sheep falls the same happens with the cross, I also implemented the title screen but due to some errors I decided not to put it in the game.

I also raised the velocity of the sheep, it is not important but I made it to make the game more dynamic.
